# AI-CLI

Simple CLI for ChatGPT.

## Requirements:

- Node version >= `18`

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Add the script to your path.
    * One method is to add `alias ai="source <.env path> && node <ai.mjs path>"` to your `.zshrc` or similar.
3. `$ ai <message>` (as `chat` is already in use on OSX.)

## Future

- Stream output
- Prompt colors
- Loading spinner
