# AI-CLI

Simple CLI for ChatGPT.

## Requirements:

- Node version >= `18`

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Add the script to your path (optional). One approach is to add `alias ai="source <.env path> && node <ai.mjs path>"`
   to your `.zshrc` or similar. Alternatively, you can simply run the script with `node ai.mjs <prompt>`.
3. `$ ai <message>`. Unfortunately, `chat` is already in use on OSX.
